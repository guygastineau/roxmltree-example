# roxmltree-example

This is a short example using [roxmltree](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/roxmltree) in Rust.
The original example is an adaptation of @efx's [example](https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml/blob/master/examples/nested_readers.rs) in the [quick-xml](https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml) project.

As I expected, I find this example very legible, and much of that is due to the idioms supported by `roxmltree`, but NB. the `quick-xml` example allow (perhaps forces) explicit attention to memory usage. As such, both libraries could be better suited to different situations.
